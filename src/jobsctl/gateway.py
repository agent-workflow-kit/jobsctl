"""Gateway: the single boundary for subprocess and HTTP calls.

Every call this tool makes to an external program (and, later, over HTTP) goes through this
module so that tests can substitute fakes (fake binaries in ``tests/fakebin/`` or a patched
function). Commands are always run as argv lists, never through a shell, and untrusted text is
passed via stdin or files, never in argv or the environment.
